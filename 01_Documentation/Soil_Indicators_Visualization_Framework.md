# Soil Contamination Indicators Visualization Framework

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive visualization schemes for soil contamination indicators in war-induced environmental assessment, created to complement the methodological framework collection for scientific publications.

## Generated Visualization Schemes

### 1. Soil Indicators Classification Matrix (`Soil_Indicators_Classification_Matrix.png`)

**Purpose**: Comprehensive categorization and priority framework for soil contamination indicators

**Key Components**:
- **Four Main Categories**:
  - Chemical Indicators (Heavy metals, explosive residues, PFAS, pH, EC)
  - Physical Indicators (Bulk density, texture, infiltration, moisture, temperature)
  - Biological Indicators (Organic matter, microbial activity, enzymes, respiration, bioavailability)
  - Nutritional Indicators (NPK nutrients, CEC, trace elements, C/N ratio, mineralization)

- **Analysis Workflow**: Six-step process from site assessment to reporting
- **Detailed Classification Matrix**: Complete breakdown of indicators by category
- **Priority Matrix**: Time-based analysis priorities (immediate, short-term, medium-term, long-term)
- **Persistence vs Timing Chart**: Optimal analysis timing versus environmental persistence

**Applications**:
- Research planning and indicator selection
- Budget allocation and resource planning
- Temporal monitoring strategy development
- Scientific publication methodology sections

### 2. Soil Analysis Methods Flowchart (`Soil_Analysis_Methods_Flowchart.png`)

**Purpose**: Comprehensive analytical methods and equipment framework

**Key Components**:
- **Six Method Categories**:
  - Field Methods: Simple, low-cost field measurements ($50-500)
  - Physical Analysis: Medium complexity structural assessments ($100-1000)
  - Chemical Analysis: Complex laboratory techniques ($1000-5000)
  - Biological Analysis: Advanced biological assessments ($500-2000)
  - Quality Control: Essential QA/QC procedures ($200-800)
  - Data Management: Information systems and analysis ($1000-10000)

- **Workflow Connections**: Logical progression from field to laboratory to data analysis
- **Sampling Strategy Framework**: Four critical aspects of sample collection
- **Method Selection Decision Matrix**: Budget, time, and expertise considerations

**Applications**:
- Laboratory method selection
- Equipment procurement planning
- Training program development
- Standard operating procedure design

### 3. Soil Indicators Cost-Benefit Analysis (`Soil_Indicators_Cost_Benefit_Analysis.png`)

**Purpose**: Economic optimization framework for indicator selection

**Key Components**:
- **Cost vs Reliability Scatter Plot**: Analysis costs versus measurement reliability
- **Multi-criteria Decision Matrix**: Four evaluation criteria across all indicators
- **Cumulative Cost Analysis**: Comprehensive vs essential indicator costs over time
- **ROI vs Implementation Difficulty**: Return on investment versus technical complexity

**Applications**:
- Budget optimization and resource allocation
- Cost-effectiveness evaluation
- Stakeholder decision support
- Project economic justification
